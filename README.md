# ðŸ§ª A/B Testing Simulator & Conversion Analysis

This project simulates an A/B test to evaluate the performance of two different landing pages in terms of user conversion. The goal is to demonstrate statistical testing, data visualization, and data storytelling in the context of product experimentation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Simulate and analyze the results of an A/B test using Python
- Perform hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance
- Visualize conversion rates and provide actionable insights
- Package everything into a readable and replicable workflow

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn)
- SQL (optional future extension)
- Excel (for presentation or summary)
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Summary

- 20,000 simulated user sessions split between Group A and Group B
- Group B shows a higher conversion rate (13% vs. 11%)
- Z-test for proportions shows statistically significant difference (p < 0.05)
- Recommendation: rollout version B
